# dorsalAestheticsFinal

this system allows researchers to display dynamic artistic imagery in order to test how movement perception affects viewers' responses
on the AESTHEMOS subscale for proto-typical emotions.

The system is run using Main.

# STIMULI:
researchers are able to use any program to generate the stimuli. As long as the stimuli are saved as individual frames (jpegs)
and are located within the appropriate subfolders, the system is able to load them.
# NOTE:
in the current version there is a limit of 3 stimuli with 72 frames each.
We have added some sample fractal imagery to the repository to be used as stimuli. These were created by us, and can easily be exchanged 
as desired by others.

# OUTPUT DATA:
the output data (=participant responses) are saved in a csv file. The file name will be the participant number. 
# NOTE: 
the participant number can be adjusted within Main. (see the top line of the code)
